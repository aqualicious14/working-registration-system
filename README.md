# working-registration-system
This code uses php and mysql to allow for a working registration and login system.
I used a software called xampp which allows to me to easily integrate the use of MySQL and PHP together.
Xampp also allows me to use a localhost to host my code to test if it works. 
For xampp to recognise my code, I need to put it inside a specific folder, the "htdocs" folder.

# login-random-game
Added a level and xp system to the code. Now after logging in you can play the famous random game where you have to guess the number between 1 and 10. If you get it correct, you gain an xp point. If you get 10 xp points you level up. All of this information is stored in a mysql database.
