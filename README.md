# working-registration-system
This code uses php and mysql to allow for a working registration and login system.
I used a software called xampp which allows to me to easily integrate the use of MySQL and PHP together.
Xampp also allows me to use a localhost to host my code to test if it works. 
For xampp to recognise my code, I need to put it inside a specific folder, the "htdocs" folder.
